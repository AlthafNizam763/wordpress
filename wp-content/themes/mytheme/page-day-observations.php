            The Research Academy for Creative Excellence (RACE) launched a Bio-Farming initiative for International
            Youth Day, focusing on transforming food systems through youth innovation. This project empowered young
            participants to engage in organic cultivation, growing various vegetables and legumes using sustainable
            methods. By emphasizing small-scale, eco-friendly farming, the initiative bridged the gap between human
            health and environmental protection. Ultimately, these hands-on activities provided youth with practical
            tools to produce nutrient-dense food while fostering a deeper commitment to long-term planetary health.
